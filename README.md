# Design Patterns in TypeScript

Here are the implementations of the following design patterns in TypeScript:

### Creational

-   [Singleton](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/Singleton.md)
-   [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/AbstractFactory.md)
-   [Factory Method](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/FactoryMethod.md)
-   [Builder](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/Builder.md)
-   [Prototype](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/Prototype.md)

### Structural Patterns

-   [Adapter](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/adapter.md)
-   [Bridge](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/bridge.md)
-   [Composite](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/composite.md)
-   [Decorator](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/decorator.md)
-   [Facade](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/facade.md)
-   [Flyweight](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/flyweight.md)
-   [Proxy](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/proxy.md)

### Behavioral Patterns

-   [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/chain_of_responsibility.md)
-   [Command](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/command.md)
-   [Interpreter](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/interpreter.md)
-   [Iterator](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/iterator.md)
-   [Mediator](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/mediator.md)
-   [Memento](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/memento.md)
-   [Observer](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/observer.md)
-   [State](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/state.md)
-   [Strategy](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/strategy.md)
-   [Template Method](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/template_method.md)
-   [Visitor](https://github.com/damianpumar/DesignPatternsGOF/tree/master/Creational/visitor.md)

## Compile the project

    $ git clone https://github.com/damianpumar/design_patterns_in_typescript.git
    $ cd design_patterns_in_typescript
    $ npm i
    $ npm run build

There is a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory which is responsible for the compiler options.

As it is set the default target is Ecmascript5 now.

Any additional options come here.

By default the output is a `patterns.js` file.

## Execute the project

After the compilation of the project, a `patterns.js` is generated by default.
Executing the file is:

    npm run build (for build and start project)
    npm run start (only start project)
